QUESTION -1 What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);

ANS- if "length" property in this code snippet reduced to zero when javascript excutes clothes.length=0; 
then all the items of an array "clothes" will be deleted.
So, clothes[0] is undefined as an array "clothes" get emptied.
